#Landing page that was created for GTP3

Welcome. This is my first project that I created using React.js. I have created a structure of different components to make the page easy to manage and update. Each component comes with a JSX and css file so styles are split up. It uses the BEM methodology for naming Classes, making it easier to code and style. 

The design was by AR Shakir. I took one of his Freebie designs and created it. His website is: https://www.arshakir.com/


Here is the landing page that I uploaded into a free domain using InfinityFree.

I hope you enjoy my work.
